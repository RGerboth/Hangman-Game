# Hangman-Game
A Start Trek-themed hangman game.

## Overview
This hangman game is written in straight JavaScrip with a font from Google Fonts. This is a fundamental exercise in manipulating arrays, creating the logic to randomly select and display a challenge word, check guessed letters against the current challenge word, track correct and incorrect guesses and keep score. DOM manipulation is handled with native JavaScript *document.getElementById* functions.
